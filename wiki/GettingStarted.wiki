= Getting started with JTV =

== Backend ==
 # Check if the prerequisits are met: JtvBackendPrerequisites
 # Download the latest JTV source release, unzip it to a directory
 # BuildJtvFromSource
 # edit the Spring configuration: QuickBackendSpringConfiguration
 # start the backend by invoking {{{tvBackend.sh}}}

Then...
 * watch live television, with VLC for example: {{{vlc http://<tvservername>:2000/watch?tunerNumber=0}}}
 * change the channel, type {{{changeChannel 0 7}}} where you started the backend (change to channel 7 for tuner 0)
 * record a program, type {{{schedulerecording 3 20:40 22:30 /data/tv/nameOfRecording.mpg}}} where you started the backend (record a show on channel 3 from 20h40 to 22h30 and save it as a file with the given name)
 * watch a recorded show, continuing the same example navigate to {{{data/tv}}} and open the file {{{nameOfRecording.mpg}}} to watch it.

You can watch a tv programme while recording it. This allows you to pause, skip and rewind "live" TV. 

JTV doesn't have a dedicated media player. Use {{{mplayer}}} or {{{vlc}}} for example to watch live streams or recorded files.
